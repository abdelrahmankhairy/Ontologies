# Ontology

Ontologies play a crucial role in building knowledge bases by providing a structured framework to define and categorize the information within a domain. 
An ontology is essentially a formal representation of a set of concepts and the relationships between them. 
This structure allows for the clear specification of the terms used in a domain and how they interrelate, enabling both humans and machines to communicate more effectively.

In knowledge bases, ontologies facilitate the sharing and reuse of domain knowledge, making assumptions explicit and separating domain knowledge from operational knowledge. 
They support interoperability among diverse systems and enhance data integration by providing a common vocabulary that standardizes how information is represented and interpreted. 
This semantic clarity ensures that data can be accurately combined, queried, and analyzed across different systems and applications, thus improving the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval and decision-making processes​​​​.

## What are knowledge bases?

A knowledge base (KB) is a repository that stores complex structured and unstructured information, typically using ontologies to define relationships and semantics. 
It supports advanced querying and reasoning, enabling applications like AI and natural language processing. 
KBs integrate diverse data sources and provide context-rich insights, facilitating knowledge discovery and decision-making.

In contrast, conventional databases (DBs) focus on storing structured data in tables, using SQL for data manipulation and retrieval. 
They excel in transaction processing, ensuring data integrity and consistency. 
However, DBs lack the semantic understanding and inferencing capabilities inherent in knowledge bases, limiting their ability to handle complex, interconnected data.

## More on this Project

In this project, we are using an Ontology to build a knowledge base which enables us to query our data to answer a series of competency questions. 
These competency questions aim to ensure that our data and structure meet the required domain and scope.
